\section{Introduction}
This is a log file for the project. Here I'll explain my thought process and the things I've done during each week.
\section{Week 1}
Installed Coq. Use the command \verb|sudo apt install coq|\\
Coq is a proof assistant. As a hello world program we can write a proof for the theorem . For all theorems if there exists a proof for it then there exists a proof for it. This can be written in coq as\\ \\
\verb|Theorem my_first_proof : (forall A: Prop, A->A).|\\
\verb|Proof.|\\
\verb|	intros A.|\\
\verb|	intros proof_of_A.|\\
\verb|	exact proof_of_A.|\\
\verb|Qed.|\\
