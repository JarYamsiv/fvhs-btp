\chapter{Dependent types}

    Dependent types are types whose definition depends on a value, it is an overlapping feature of \textit{type
theory} and \textit{type systems}. Dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like \textit{forall}
 and \textit{there exists}. In functional programming languages like \textit{Agda , ATS , Coq , F* , Epigram}
and \textit{Idris} dependent types may help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that 
further restrain the set of possible implementations.
