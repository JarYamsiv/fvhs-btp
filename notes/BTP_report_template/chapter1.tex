    The project involves writing formal specification of hardware, and using proof assistant to
formally verify the correctness of the implementation of the same.

\section{Coq -  proof assistant}
    Here for writing specifications and proof for the same specifications we use a proof assistant called
Coq, Coq is an interactive theorem proover. It allows the expression of mathematical assertions , mechanically
checks the proof for these assertions, helps to find formal proofs and extracts a certified program from the
constructive proof of it's formal specification. official website: \href{https://coq.inria.fr/}{Coq official site}

\section{VHDL -  the current target language}
    Currently the target language is set to be VHDL. The candidates for this were initially VHDL , Verilog
and BlueSpec but due to licensing and certain other issues it is decided that the verifier will target VHDL


\section{Organization of The Report}

You can write the about organization of your report in the following manner.

This chapter provides a background for the topics covered in this
report. We provided a description of wireless ad hoc networks, and
their applications. Then we described the network model that
represents the topology of wireless ad hoc networks \cite{Omar2016}. In this
chapter it is shown that the virtual backbone for wireless ad hoc
networks can be represented by a connected dominating set. We
explained clustering concepts and lastly the difference between
centralized and distributed algorithms are also discussed. The
rest of the chapters are organised as follows: next chapter we
provide review of prior works. In Chapter 3 and 4, we discuss our
new algorithms for constructing small backbones for ad-hoc
wireless network. And finally in chapter 6, we conclude with some
future works.
